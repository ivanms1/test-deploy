# CONUN Drive DApp

## About the project

The CONUN Drive DApp is a peer-to-peer file-sharing platform that runs on the CONUN blockchain network.

When files are uploaded, downloaded, or 'liked', these actions are registered in the blockchain as transactions.
This results in a decentralised system that doesn't rely on a single server storing the details needed to connect to peers to download files.

Drive requires a running instance of the CONUN Manager to connect to the blockchain network.
Under normal usage, the Drive app is started from the CONUN Manager. Be sure to download that application first.
